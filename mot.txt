Hi, please create a react web based app, for medical flashcards. So, do each step at a time, and let me approve each one before proceding. 1. Create a react app npm (use vite or whatever you consider best for this purpose). 2. Create a components folder with a flash.js or jsx depends. 3. On flash, set up the pages logic. For the logic: 4. Give me a minimalistc, web app, with a flashcard that: can be cliked for turning, counts the number of flashcards done and availabe. 5. Use for style white colors palate, maybe blue also based on a medical app. 6. Decide how to store the flash card information, I plan to host this app freely on firebase, so maybe usingn a firebase db is better ? or maybe using a json type file to store flashcards information would be better, tell me which approach is better and why. 7. based on the DB approach, create the db of the flashcards, For example:  antibiotic name as front and back would be the mechanism of action, or maybe the enzybe it inhibits, and so on. Add 10 - 20 examples for testing fucntionality. 8. Run the app locally and test for functionality.
